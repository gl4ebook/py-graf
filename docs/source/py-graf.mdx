# Outlining the Core Principles for Designing, Building and Contributing to Py-graph


## Scope and objectives of the library
First, you should determine the scope of the library and the specific objectives that it should achieve. For example, the library might be designed to support the training and inference of graph neural networks on large-scale graphs.

## Overall architecture

Next, we should design the overall architecture of the library. This should include the main classes and functions that will make up the library, as well as the relationships between these components.
You should also consider how the library will be extended and customized by users.

## Core functionality implementation

This should include the main classes and functions that will be used to train and infer on graph neural networks, as well as any supporting functions or utilities.

## Testing the library
After implementing the core functionality, we should thoroughly test the library to ensure that it is reliable and performs as expected.
This should include unit tests, integration tests, and performance tests.

## Documenting the library
we should document the library so that users can understand how to use it and how it is designed.
This should include a user guide, API documentation, and any additional documentation that may be helpful to users.
